# HW Week10: Due Tuesday Week11

Now that we have covered some introductory Javascript principles, it's time for a HW assignment dedicated to vanilla Javascript. Next Tuesday anyone who volunteers to demo their HW assignment will recieve BONUS participation points. This extra credit is a big one. It will either cancel out a class absence (3+ unexcused absences results in the drop of a whole letter grade on your final grade) or as 3% additional credit on your final project.

Assignment: Write your own Javascript function (or functions) from scratch. This means you name, write, and use a function. For example: maybe you write a function to dynamically change the content or styles on an HTML page, or build a tool to calculate something for a user, or even a simple quiz, horoscope or game. You could also format and display some fairly large JSON data (that you write yourself, or retrieve from an API). The only requirements are that you write the javascript yourself (not following a tutorial to make a slideshow step by step). Ideally, there are some HTML elements on the page for the user to interact with (not just a console.log() result).
