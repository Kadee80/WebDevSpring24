# HW Week07: Due Thursday Week08

Complete your midterm projects. You will be presenting Thursday of March 14. Please be sure to document your project with either a slideshow or a markdown file inside your class repo. Be sure to include:

- A demo of the site and the progress you have made
- A snippet of code you figured out (perhaps a tutorial you found or some responsive behavior you figured out)
- Be sure to include at least one media query in your CSS for responsive behavior. If you are only picking one media query, make sure it is mobile `(max-width: 768px)`. I will be asking you to resize you screen when you demo!
- Next steps (if you had more time, or if you plan on continuing to add functionality for your final)
- Your midterm project code and documentation (and copy of slideshow if applicable) must be present in your repo.
- Presenation is part of your midterm grade, this is how it is marked on-time. I will not be grading your _code_ until Thursday, March 21. You will have an entire week after your presentation to continue coding your project. If you make any considerable changes within the extra week, please email me so that I am aware your project may look/behave differently than when you presented.

## IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN NEXT THURSDAY

Some of you have shared with me excused absences for March 14. If this is the case, it is up to you to email me and schedule a time BEFORE March 14 to present your project to me via zoom/google meeting.

- If you are excused for Thursday, but will be available Tuesday. You will present Tuesday March 12. (Rememeber, you still have another week to continue working on your code before I grade it.)
- If you are traveling/out of the country (and I have received an accomodation notice from NYU offices) you must email me by FIRDAY THIS WEEK to schedule a time on or before March 14 to present your project via Zoom/Google-Meeting. Failure to present your midterm next week will result in the loss of a FULL LETTER GRADE on your midterm.
