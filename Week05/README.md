# Midterm Project Proposals Due Thursday, Feb 22

This Thursday you will present a quick 2-3 minute project proposal. This is a check in to get you started thinking about what you are going to build for your midterm website. Whatever you pick for your midterm could grow into your final project as well. I am only grading you on HTML, CSS, and Respsonsive Design.

## Midterm Project Proposal Checklist:

Students in the past have found it easiest to present with a short slide show. You are welcome to present your thoughts/designs in whatever format you feel most comfortable. No matter how you present be sure to include the following:

1.  Concept or Theme of your website. For example: "I would like to build a portfolio website showcasing my work in photography, design and coding".
2.  A list or pinterest collection of websites or designs that you drew inspiration from. Maybe you liked a hover effect on the navigation on one site, the color scheme of another, and the minimalist layout of a third.
3.  Rough schematics/wireframes of your basic page layout. Remember, wireframes are supposed to communicate how components of your page are laid out in the browser window. Do yourself a favor, and try to consider how your desktop designs might shift on a mobile screen now.
4.  A list of HTML and CSS skills you have learned so far you will utilized to complete your project.
5.  A list of concepts/skills/components you are unsure of how to build, or things you still need to learn/research to build your desired website.

## HW Week05 - Midterm Project Presentations are on March 14

Now that you have presented your midterm project proposal, start working on it! Your presentation should have included at least one simple wireframe for a general page layout. I suggest tackling your general page layout with the flexbox skills we practice this week. Content and more UI flourishes can be built in after, but the "boxes" for your content, and how they are displayed on both desktop and mobile is an excelent place to start styling.
