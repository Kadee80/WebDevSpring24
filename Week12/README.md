# Class THURSDAY will be held via ZOOM

Class **This Thursday** will be held via Zoom. I will be sending out an email as a reminder as well as a follow up email with the Zoom invites Wednesday.

## HW - Begin working on your final project!

Once you have recieved a thumbs up from me on your Final Project proposal, get started on coding! I recommend starting with containers and your grid system, rows and columns before filling out content. Just like the Midterm, your Final requires _at least one_ media query for mobile (<768px).

Class topics for the remaining classes:

- Bootstrap components and grid system
- Local Storage
- Green Sock Animation Platform (tweens, timelines, and smooth scrolling animations)
- Getting started with the Google Maps API

_and if we have time, we can vote on the following topics..._

- CSS Variables
- Intro to SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
- Hello React!
